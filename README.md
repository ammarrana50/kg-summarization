# KG-SUMMARIZATION

## Project Title
Knowledge Graph Summarization

## Description
Knowledge graphs (KG) are graphs/structures consisting of facts in the form of triples. Triples
are a combination of subjects, objects and predicates. In general, knowledge graphs are huge
in size and may contain redundant information. Knowledge Graphsâ€™ humongous size makes it
difficult to process and represent them. The goal of this project group is to obtain a pruned KG.
This consists of selecting a sub knowledge graph based on endpoints and summarizing those
subgraphs by considering facts based on ranks. 


## Installation / Project Setup

Run maven install.
Run maven clean.
Run maven build.
Run Project as KgsmrstnApplication.java file.
